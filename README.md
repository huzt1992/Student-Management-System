# Student-Management-System
A console based student management system which has three groups of users: students, professors and admins. Each user can log in and then review individual information such as course list, course schedule, course grade etc. The system also allows users to update information within their authority.

**Since this project is school course work, the source code and specific instruction are not allowed to post publicly. Below is a demo showing partial functionality of this system**
